/* From the Vulkan 1.3.274 spec:
 *
 *    VUID-VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo-pPushConstantRanges-00292
 *
 *    "Any two elements of pPushConstantRanges must not include the same
 *    stage in stageFlags"
 *
 * and
 *
 *    VUID-VkPushConstantRange-stageFlags-requiredbitmask
 *
 *    "stageFlags must not be 0"
 *
 * This means that the number of push constant ranges is effectively bounded
 * by the number of possible shader stages.  Not the number of stages that can
 * be compiled together (a pipeline layout can be used in multiple pipelnes
 * wth different sets of shaders) but the total number of stage bits supported
 * by the implementation.  Currently, those are
 *
 *    - VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT
 *    - VK_SHADER_STAGE_TESSELLATION_CONTROL_BIT
 *    - VK_SHADER_STAGE_TESSELLATION_EVALUATION_BIT
 *    - VK_SHADER_STAGE_GEOMETRY_BIT
 *    - VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT
 *    - VK_SHADER_STAGE_COMPUTE_BIT
 *    - VK_SHADER_STAGE_RAYGEN_BIT_KHR
 *    - VK_SHADER_STAGE_ANY_HIT_BIT_KHR
 *    - VK_SHADER_STAGE_CLOSEST_HIT_BIT_KHR
 *    - VK_SHADER_STAGE_MISS_BIT_KHR
 *    - VK_SHADER_STAGE_INTERSECTION_BIT_KHR
 *    - VK_SHADER_STAGE_CALLABLE_BIT_KHR
