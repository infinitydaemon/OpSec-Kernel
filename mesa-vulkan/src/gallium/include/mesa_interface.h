    * opposed to any pending, requested change to EGL_RENDER_BUFFER) is
    * EGL_SINGLE_BUFFER.

    * If buffer_mask contains __DRI_IMAGE_BUFFER_SHARED, then must contains no
    * other bits. As a corollary, a struct dri_drawable that has a "shared" buffer
    * has no front nor back buffer.
    *
    * The loader returns __DRI_IMAGE_BUFFER_SHARED in buffer_mask if and only
    * if:
    *     - The loader supports __DRI_MUTABLE_RENDER_BUFFER_LOADER.
    *     - The driver supports __DRI_MUTABLE_RENDER_BUFFER_DRIVER.
    *     - The EGLConfig of the drawable EGLSurface contains
    *       EGL_MUTABLE_RENDER_BUFFER_BIT_KHR.
    *     - The EGLContext's EGL_RENDER_BUFFER is EGL_SINGLE_BUFFER.
    *       Equivalently, the EGLSurface's active EGL_RENDER_BUFFER (as
    *       opposed to any pending, requested change to EGL_RENDER_BUFFER) is
    *       EGL_SINGLE_BUFFER. (See the EGL 1.5 and
    *       EGL_KHR_mutable_render_buffer spec for details about "pending" vs
    *       "active" EGL_RENDER_BUFFER state).
    *
    * A shared buffer is similar to a front buffer in that all rendering to the
    * buffer should appear promptly on the screen. It is different from
    * a front buffer in that its behavior is independent from the
    * GL_DRAW_BUFFER state. Specifically, if GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER is 0 and the
    * struct dri_drawable's buffer_mask is __DRI_IMAGE_BUFFER_SHARED, then all
    * rendering should appear promptly on the screen if GL_DRAW_BUFFER is not
    * GL_NONE.
    *
    * The difference between a shared buffer and a front buffer is motivated
    * by the constraints of Android and OpenGL ES. OpenGL ES does not support
    * front-buffer rendering. Android's SurfaceFlinger protocol provides the
    * EGL driver only a back buffer and no front buffer. The shared buffer
    * mode introduced by EGL_KHR_mutable_render_buffer is a backdoor though
    * EGL that allows Android OpenGL ES applications to render to what is
    * effectively the front buffer, a backdoor that required no change to the
    * OpenGL ES API and little change to the SurfaceFlinger API.
