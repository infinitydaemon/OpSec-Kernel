Sign a ZerOS image for Secure Boot on the Zymbit Edge Node 400 (SCM4)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites

Before signing your ZerOS, make sure you have:
A working Zymbit Edge Node 400
A ZerOS OS image (.img file)
Access to Zymbit’s Secure Boot tools (zboot or bootware)
A trusted keypair for signing

2. Generate Secure Boot Keys (If Not Already Setup)
Zymbit Secure Boot requires a trusted keypair. 

Generate one:

openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out secureboot_private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
openssl rsa -in secureboot_private.pem -pubout -out secureboot_public.pem

This creates:

secureboot_private.pem → Used to sign images (Keep this as secret!)
secureboot_public.pem → Used to verify boot images (Load this onto SCM4)

3. Embed the Public Key in the SCM4 Secure Bootloader
To allow your board to recognize your signed OS, install the public key:

sudo zboot --install-key secureboot_public.pem

This step may require root privileges. If zboot is not found, check your Zymbit firmware documentation.

4. Sign Your Custom OS Image

Now, sign your OS image using zboot:

zboot --sign-image <your-image.img> --key secureboot_private.pem --output <signed-image.img>

This ensures that only your signed image will boot on the Edge Node 400.


Flash a New Image on Zymbit Edge Node 400
----------------------------------------
1. Boot into USB Recovery Mode

Unlike some SCM4 setups, the Edge Node 400 should automatically enter recovery mode when no valid OS is found. If needed, force it into USB recovery:

* Power off the device.
* Hold down the BOOTSEL button (if available) on the Edge Node 400.
* Connect it to your Linux PC via USB while holding the button.
* The device should now appear as a USB mass storage drive (/dev/sdX).

If no BOOTSEL button is available, try just powering the device via USB and checking lsblk to see if it appears.

2. Flash the Image

Once the device is recognized, use one of these methods:

Option 1: Using dd (Simpler)

sudo dd if=<your-image-file.img> of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
sync

(Replace /dev/sdX with the correct USB device name.)

3. Reboot and Verify

Safely eject the device:

sudo eject /dev/sdX

Power cycle the Edge Node 400.

Connect via SSH or check its status via UART.

Troubleshooting

a. Device doesn’t show up as USB storage?

Try a different USB port or cable.
Make sure the board is fully powered before checking lsblk.
Check dmesg | tail -20 for any connection errors.

b. Flashing completes, but the device doesn’t boot?

Your image might not be properly signed if Secure Boot is enabled.
Try flashing a Zymbit-provided recovery image first.
