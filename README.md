CWD SYSTEMS Linux kernel
========================

Linux Kernel that was tuned and built as Brooklyn Supreme is now OpSec Kernel.

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:
